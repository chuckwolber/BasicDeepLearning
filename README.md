# BasicDeepLearning
This is an **inefficient** Backpropagation implementation suitable for learning how deep learning works.
It was written to be readable, rather than efficient, in order to convey the essence of the Backpropagation
algorithm without the usual shortcuts one must puzzle over in a typical implementation. No background in 
Calculus should be required to understand this code, although it would not hurt.
